                It all started at Semicolon, where we were united not just by
                our friendship. Our capstone project was looming, and we were
                determined to make it something meaningful, something that could
                address a pain point we all experienced, the chaotic,
                unreliable, and costly nature of traditional delivery services
                in Lagos. The turning point came one morning, fueled by the
                shared frustration of missing packages and the delays. This
                wasn't just our problem; it was a collective pain for countless
                residents and businesses. That's when the question that changed
                everything was posed: "What if deliveries could be made by
                people who are already on their way?"
